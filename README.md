# Synthetic Reforge  
**NSF 2025 Game Maker Awards Submission**

---

## **Overview**

**Synthetic Reforge** is a Unity-based virtual reality game developed for the **NSF 2025 Game Maker Awards**. The game transports players into a **dystopian, post-human future** where robots are the last remaining caretakers of civilization.

Players take on the role of a **robot mechanic**, tasked with repairing damaged robots by carefully reattaching detached parts. Through gameplay and narrative-driven design, *Synthetic Reforge* explores the role of robotics in both future societies and real-world rehabilitation.

While the game is designed to be most impactful in **virtual reality**, the version uploaded to GitHub serves as a **keyboard-controlled version for testing, evaluation, and further development**.

## **Game Concept & Story**

In a world where humanity has vanished, robots must maintain themselves to preserve what remains of civilization. The player operates within a **rundown repair shack** set against a **futuristic skyline**, symbolizing the contrast between technological progress and environmental decay.

As the player repairs robots, dialogue reveals their circumstances, promoting **empathy and emotional connection** despite the absence of human characters. The story emphasizes care, responsibility, and the continuation of human legacy through technology.
