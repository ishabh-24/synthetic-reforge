# Synthetic Reforge  
**NSF 2025 Game Maker Awards Submission**

---

## **Overview**

**Synthetic Reforge** is a Unity-based virtual reality game developed for the **NSF 2025 Game Maker Awards**. The game transports players into a **dystopian, post-human future** where robots are the last remaining caretakers of civilization.

Players take on the role of a **robot mechanic**, tasked with repairing damaged robots by carefully reattaching detached parts. Through gameplay and narrative-driven design, *Synthetic Reforge* explores the role of robotics in both future societies and real-world rehabilitation.

While the game is designed to be most impactful in **virtual reality**, the version uploaded to GitHub serves as a **keyboard-controlled version for testing, evaluation, and further development**.

## **Game Concept & Story**

In a world where humans have disappeared, robots must maintain themselves to preserve what’s left of civilization. The game is played in a run-down repair shack against a futuristic skyline, aiming to show the gap between advanced technology and a decaying environment. As robots are repaired, dialogue describes their stories, creating empathy and emotional connection even without human characters.
